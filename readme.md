## Overview

### What I learned

 Just from building on this project, I learnt (more like applied) version control (Git and GitHub) and I feel more equipped with knowledge of how it works even though I'm not good at writing "readme" files. I gotten more familiar with CSS box model and HTML sematics/structuring; I'm glad even though I know I've got a long way to go, I'll phase through with these little baby steps.

### Useful resources

 There were just two images files, some color codes and fonts settings which were used and were provided with the challenge's guide. Coupled with these, I used <a href="https://www.w3school.com/..."> W3School's CSS course module </a> as guide through some parts of the process where I had problems.
